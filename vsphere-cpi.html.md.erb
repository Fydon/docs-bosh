title: vSphere CPI
---

This topic describes cloud properties for different resources created by the vSphere CPI.

## <a id='azs'></a> AZs

Schema for `cloud_properties` section:

* **datacenters** [Array, optional]: Array of datacenters to use for VM placement. Must have only one and it must match datacenter configured in global CPI options.
    * **name** [String, required]: Datacenter name.
    * **clusters** [Array, required]: Array of clusters to use for VM placement.

Example:

```yaml
azs:
- name: z1
  cloud_properties:
    datacenters:
    - name: my-dc
      clusters:
      - {my-vsphere-cluster: {resource_pool: my-vsphere-res-pool}}
```

---
## <a id='networks'></a> Networks

Schema for `cloud_properties` section used by manual network subnet:

* **name** [String, required]: Name of the vSphere network. Example: `VM Network`.

Example of manual network:

```yaml
networks:
- name: default
  type: manual
  subnets:
  - range: 10.10.0.0/24
    gateway: 10.10.0.1
    cloud_properties:
      name: VM Network
```

vSphere CPI does not support dynamic or vip networks.

## <a id='resource-pools'></a> Resource Pools / VM Types

Schema for `cloud_properties` section:

* **cpu** [Integer, required]: Number of CPUs. Example: `1`.
* **ram** [Integer, required]: RAM in megabytes. Example: `1024`.
* **disk** [Integer, required]: Ephemeral disk size in megabytes. Example: `10240`.
* **nested\_hardware\_virtualization** [Boolean, optional]: Exposes hardware assisted virtualization to the VM. Default: `false`.

* **datacenters** [Array, optional]: Array of datacenters to use for VM placement. Must have only one and it must match datacenter configured in global CPI options.
    * **name** [String, required]: Datacenter name.
    * **clusters** [Array, required]: Array of clusters to use for VM placement.
        * **\<cluster name\>** [String, required]: Cluster name.
            * **drs_rulers** [Array, optional]: Array of DRS rules applied to [constrain VM placement](vm-anti-affinity.html#vsphere). Must have only one.
                * **name** [String, required]: Name of a DRS rule that the Director will create.
                * **type** [String, required]: Type of a DRS rule. Currently only `separate_vms` is supported.

Example of a VM with 1 CPU, 1GB RAM, and 10GB ephemeral disk asked to be placed into a specific cluster:

```yaml
resource_pools:
- name: default
  network: default
  stemcell:
    name: bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
    version: latest
  cloud_properties:
    cpu: 1
    ram: 1_024
    disk: 10_240

    datacenters:
    - name: my-dc
      clusters:
      - my-vsphere-cluster: {}
```

And an example of a VM asked to be placed into a specific cluster in a specified vSphere resource pool:

```yaml
resource_pools:
- name: default
  network: default
  stemcell:
    name: bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
    version: latest
  cloud_properties:
    cpu: 1
    ram: 1_024
    disk: 10_240

    datacenters:
    - name: my-dc
      clusters:
      - my-vsphere-cluster: {resource_pool: my-vsphere-res-pool}
```

## <a id='disk-pools'></a> Disk Pools / Disk Types

Schema for `cloud_properties` section:

* **type** [String, optional]: Type of the [disk](http://pubs.vmware.com/vi-sdk/visdk250/ReferenceGuide/vim.VirtualDiskManager.VirtualDiskType.html): `thick`, `thin`, `preallocated`, `eagerZeroedThick`. Defaults to `preallocated`. Available in v12.

Example of 10GB disk:

```yaml
disk_pools:
- name: default
  disk_size: 10_240
```

Example of disk with type eagerZeroedThick:

```yaml
disk_pools:
- name: default
  disk_size: 10_240
  cloud_properties:
    type: eagerZeroedThick
```

## <a id='global'></a> Global Configuration

The CPI can only talk to a single vCenter installation and manage VMs within a single vSphere datacenter.

Schema:

* **host** [String, required]: IP address of the vCenter. Example: `172.16.68.3`.
* **user** [String, required]: Username for the API access. Example: `root`.
* **password** [String, required]: Password for the API access. Example: `vmware`

* **datacenters** [Array, optional]: Array of datacenters to use for VM placement. Must have only one.
    * **name** [String, required]: Datacenter name.

    * **vm_folder** [String, required]: Path to a folder (relative to the datacenter) for storing created VMs. Folder will be automatically created if not found.
    * **template_folder** [String, required]: Path to a folder (relative to the datacenter) for storing uploaded stemcells. Folder will be automatically created if not found.
    * **disk_path** [String, required]: Path to a *disk* folder for storing persistent disks. Folder will be automatically created in the datastore if not found.

    * **datastore_pattern** [String, required]: Pattern for selecting datastores for storing ephemeral disks and replicated stemcells.
    * **persistent\_datastore\_pattern** [String, required]: Pattern for selecting datastores for storing persistent disks.

    * **clusters** [Array, required]: Array of clusters to use for VM placement.
        * **\<cluster name\>** [String, required]: Cluster name.
            * **resource_pool** [String, optional]: Specific vSphere resource pool to use within the cluster.

Example of a CPI configuration that will place VMs into `BOSH_CL` cluster within `BOSH_DC`:

```yaml
properties:
  vsphere:
    host: 172.16.68.3
    user: root
    password: vmware
    datacenters:
    - name: BOSH_DC
      vm_folder: prod-vms
      template_folder: prod-templates
      disk_path: prod-disks
      datastore_pattern: '\Aprod-ds\z'
      persistent_datastore_pattern: '\Aprod-ds\z'
      clusters: [BOSH_CL]
```

Or example that places VMs by default into `BOSH_RP` vSphere resource pool:

```yaml
properties:
  vsphere:
    host: 172.16.68.3
    user: root
    password: vmware
    datacenters:
    - name: BOSH_DC
      vm_folder: prod-vms
      template_folder: prod-templates
      disk_path: prod-disks
      datastore_pattern: '\Aprod-ds\z'
      persistent_datastore_pattern: '\Aprod-ds\z'
      clusters:
      - BOSH_CL: {resource_pool: BOSH_RP}
```

## <a id='notes'></a> Notes

* Assigned VM names (e.g. `vm-8dg349-s7cn74-...`) should not be manually changed since the CPI uses them to find created VMs. You can use [`bosh vms --details`](sysadmin-commands.html#health) to find which VM is assigned which job. VMs are also tagged with their assigned job, index and deployment.

* Storage DRS and vMotion can be used with vSphere CPI version v18 and above. For additional details see [Storage DRS and vMotion Support](vsphere-vmotion-support.html).

* `allow_mixed_datastores` configuration has been deprecated in favor of setting same datastore pattern for `datastore_pattern` and `persistent_datastore_pattern` keys.

## <a id='errors'></a> Errors

```
Field object_set is not optional
```

This error may occur when global CPI configuration references:

- cluster (via `clusters` key) that cannot be found in the datacenter
- stemcell that cannot be found in the templates folder

```
...should have the following properties: ["info.progress", "info.state", "info.result", "info.error"] (VSphereCloud::CloudSearcher::MissingPropertiesException), but they were missing these: #<Set: {"info.state"}>
```

Add `System.View` on vCenter server level so that persistent disks can be moved between the datastores.

```
Field counter_id is not optional
...lib/cloud/vsphere/client.rb:270:in `fetch_perf_metric_names'
```

The CPI requires access to performance metrics from ESXi hosts. This error may be returned if one of the hosts in the cluster is not returning these metrics (e.g. `memory.usage.average`). Possible solution is to [restart management agents](http://www.running-system.com/no-cpu-and-memory-usage-data-from-host-available-in-vcenter/) on the hosts.

```
Failed to add disk scsi0:2.
```

This error typically occurs when persistent disk is being attached to a second VM while it is attached to another VM. That may happen when first VM was not properly deleted and BOSH is no longer aware of its existence.
